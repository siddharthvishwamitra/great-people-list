  "bio": "Lord Rama is one of the most revered deities in Hinduism and the central character of the epic Ramayana. Considered the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu, Rama was born to destroy evil and uphold Dharma. His life reflects the ideals of a perfect son, ideal husband, noble king, and an unwavering adherent to truth and justice. Rama accepted exile to honor his father’s promise, defeated the demon king Ravana, and restored dharma to the world. His reign is considered the golden age — ‘Rama Rajya’.",
  "lifeSummary": "Lord Rama’s life is a divine example of duty, honor, and righteousness. From obeying his father’s harsh command to exile, to waging a just war against adharma, to ruling as a wise and selfless king, Rama never deviated from Dharma. Though faced with deep personal trials, including the separation from Sita, he placed the welfare of his people above all. Worshipped as the embodiment of virtue and the Supreme Being in many traditions, Rama's name is synonymous with truth, purity, and divine conduct. His story inspires millions to walk the path of righteousness with courage and humility."
