  "bio": "Ved Vyasa, also known as Krishna Dvaipayana, is one of the greatest sages in Hindu tradition. He is credited with composing the Mahabharata, the longest epic in the world, and also compiling and categorizing the four Vedas. He authored the 18 major Puranas and the Brahma Sutras, making him a foundational figure in Sanatana Dharma. Born of divine heritage, Vyasa was a seer with deep insight into time, destiny, and dharma. His name 'Vyasa' means 'compiler' or 'arranger', reflecting his life’s mission to preserve sacred wisdom.",
  "lifeSummary": "Vyasa’s life was dedicated to ensuring that the spiritual and philosophical knowledge of the Vedas was accessible to future generations. He divided the Vedas into four parts—Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva—for the benefit of humanity. Through the Mahabharata, he conveyed profound lessons on dharma, karma, and morality. He fathered Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura to continue the Kuru lineage, playing a direct role in shaping the epic's events. Even though he witnessed suffering and war, he remained detached, always serving as a guiding light of wisdom. Vyasa is also considered a Chiranjivi (immortal) and is honored every year on Guru Purnima."
