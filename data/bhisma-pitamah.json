He was unmatched in commitment to dharma, loyalty, and wisdom. Bhishma voluntarily chose the time of his death after lying on a bed of arrows until the end of the war.",
  "lifeSummary": "Bhishma's life is one of sacrifice, discipline, and moral steadfastness. He served generations of kings in Hastinapur, acting as regent, counselor, and protector.

His tragic role in the Mahabharata reflects the complexity of dharma, as he chose duty over personal belief. His death marked the fall of the old era and the rise of a new age."
