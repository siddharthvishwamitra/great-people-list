  "bio": "Jesus of Nazareth, also known as Jesus Christ, is the central figure of Christianity and regarded as the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Born in humble circumstances, he began his ministry at around age 30, preaching about the Kingdom of God, compassion, and salvation. His teachings emphasized love for all, even enemies, forgiveness, and humility. He was crucified by Roman authorities but is believed to have risen from the dead on the third day, an event celebrated as Easter.",
  "lifeSummary": "Jesus lived a life devoted to divine purpose, healing the sick, comforting the poor, and challenging religious hypocrisy. He was revered for his miracles, wisdom, and unconditional love. His Sermon on the Mount remains one of the most powerful moral guides in human history. Despite betrayal and suffering, he forgave those who crucified him. His resurrection became the foundation of Christian faith, symbolizing eternal life, hope, and victory over sin. To this day, Jesus is revered not just as a religious figure, but as a symbol of ultimate love, sacrifice, and grace."
