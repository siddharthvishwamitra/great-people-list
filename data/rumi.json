  "bio": "Jalāl ad-Dīn Rūmī, commonly known as Rumi, was a 13th-century Persian poet, Islamic scholar, and Sufi mystic. His teachings centered on divine love, the unity of all existence, and the transformation of the soul through devotion. After meeting his spiritual companion Shams of Tabriz, Rumi underwent a deep mystical transformation that inspired thousands of verses of poetry. His magnum opus, the *Masnavi*, remains one of the most influential works in spiritual literature worldwide.",
  "lifeSummary": "Rumi’s life was a journey of spiritual awakening. Born in Balkh and later settling in Konya (Turkey), he became a celebrated theologian and teacher. However, the arrival of Shams of Tabriz transformed him into a mystic and poet. Rumi’s works explore the themes of love, the soul’s longing for God, and the path to union with the divine. His message transcends religious and cultural boundaries, and his poetry continues to resonate with seekers of all backgrounds. Rumi believed that love was the bridge between the human and the divine, and he lived his life spreading that love in word and spirit."
