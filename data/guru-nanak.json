  "bio": "Guru Nanak Dev Ji was the founder of Sikhism and the first of the ten Sikh Gurus. From a young age, he exhibited a deep spiritual nature and questioned religious divisions and social inequality. He believed in one formless God who resides in all. Through his divine hymns, simplicity, and message of universal brotherhood, Guru Nanak laid the foundation for a new spiritual path that emphasized devotion, honesty, equality, and service. He traveled extensively across India, Tibet, Arabia, and Persia, engaging with people of all faiths to spread love and unity.",
  "lifeSummary": "Guru Nanak’s teachings revolutionized the spiritual landscape of his time. He introduced the concept of 'Ik Onkar'—One Supreme Reality—and rejected idol worship and rigid priesthood. His three pillars—Naam Japna (remembering God), Kirat Karni (honest living), and Vand Chakna (sharing with others)—remain the core principles of Sikh life. After years of spiritual travel, he settled in Kartarpur where he built a community based on equality and devotion. His legacy lives on in the Guru Granth Sahib and the worldwide Sikh community that continues to follow his path of truth, humility, and service."
